// This file is a placeholder for the changes needed in the WeeklyAssignments component
// Since WeeklyAssignments.tsx is not included in the allowed files list for editing,
// we're creating this file to document the changes needed:

/*
In the WeeklyAssignments component, add the following roles after "עריכה" and "הפקה":
1. "עריכה ראשית" 
2. "הפקת ערב"

These should be added to the role options dropdown or wherever the roles are defined in that file.

The actual implementation would involve adding these items to the roles array or similar structure,
like this:

const roles = [
  { id: "editing", name: "עריכה" },
  { id: "producing", name: "הפקה" },
  { id: "chief_editing", name: "עריכה ראשית" },  // New role
  { id: "evening_producing", name: "הפקת ערב" }   // New role
];
*/

// This is just documentation, not actual code to be used directly.
// The maintainer needs to find the role definitions in WeeklyAssignments.tsx
// and add these two new roles.
