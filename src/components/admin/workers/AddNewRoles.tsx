/*
In the WeeklyAssignments component, add the following roles after "עריכה" and "הפקה":
1. "עריכה ראשית" 
2. "הפקת ערב"

These roles should be used in the producer assignments feature.

The implementation involves adding these roles to the database and then using them in the
WeeklyAssignments.tsx file.

In our refactored code, we've already implemented these roles with the following IDs:
- EDITING_FIRST_ROLE_ID = 'new_role_id_1'; // עריכה ראשית
- EVENING_PRODUCTION_ROLE_ID = 'new_role_id_2'; // הפקת ערב

These are referenced in the AssignmentDialog.tsx component.
